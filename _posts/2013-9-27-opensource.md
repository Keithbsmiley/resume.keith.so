While working on my other projects I have followed Tom Preston-Werners
phyilosophy of
[Open Source (Almost)
Everything](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/11/22/open-source-everything.html).
Under that principle I have open sourced components of Sail, I have
contributed back to projects I use in Bartlett's iOS app and I have open
sourced many of the custom development tools I use on a daily basis.
