[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a Ruby based tool for managing 3rd party
dependencies in Objective-C projects. I began managing the repository of
library specifications and contributing small amounts to the tool itself, while
submitting my own projects to CocoaPods. I have since become the primary specs
repo maintainers where I manage 3rd party submissions to CocoaPods.
