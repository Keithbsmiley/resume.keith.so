I worked as a Cocoa developer at [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com). We
focused on creating awesome products with great design and high quality
code. While at thoughtbot, I worked on products at very different stages
of development. This included brand new iOS apps, prototyping proof of
concepts, and legacy codebases.
