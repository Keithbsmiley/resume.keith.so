I created a Universal iOS app for Bartlett Tree Experts. The application
serves as a quick reference guide for employees in the field and allows
representatives to quickly and easily diagnose the disease or pest that
is causing plant failure. I have been working as the sole developer on the
project for almost 2 years, requiring me to manage the entire
development cycle while supporting iOS 5 and up.
