I am a Cocoa developer at [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com). We focus
on creating awesome products with great design and high quality code.
While at thoughtbot, I have worked on products at very different stages
of development. This includes brand new iOS apps, prototyping proof of
concepts, and legacy codebases.
