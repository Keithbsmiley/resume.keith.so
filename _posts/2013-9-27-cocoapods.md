[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a Ruby based tool for managing 3rd
party dependencies in Objective-C projects. While submitting my own
projects to CocoaPods I began managing the repository of library
specifications and contributing small amounts to the tool itself. I have
since become the primary specs repo maintainers where I manage the
majority of 3rd party submissions to CocoaPods.
