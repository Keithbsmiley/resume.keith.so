I created a Universal iOS app for Bartlett Tree Experts. The application
serves as a quick reference guide for employees in the field and allows
representatives to quickly and easily diagnose the disease or pest that
is causing plant failure. I was the sole developer on the project for
almost 2 years as I finished college.
