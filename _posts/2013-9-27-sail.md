[Sail](http://sailforapp.net/) is a small application for quickly
posting your thoughts to [App.net](https://app.net) and Twitter from Mac
OS X. I started this project over a year ago and have been iterating on
it ever since. It reached number 126 on the Top Paid section of the
US App Store a few months after it was released.
