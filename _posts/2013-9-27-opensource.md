While working on my iOS and OS X projects, I have followed the [Open
Source (Almost)
Everything](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/11/22/open-source-everything.html)
philosophy. Under that principle, I have open sourced components created
while working on internal projects at thoughtbot, I have open sourced
many components of Sail, I have contributed back to projects I used in
Bartlett's iOS app and client projects at thoughtbot, and I have open
sourced many of the custom development tools I use on a daily basis.
