[Sail](http://sailforapp.net/) was a small application for quickly
posting your thoughts to [App.net](https://app.net) and Twitter from OS
X. I shipped Sail and iterated on it until App.net [went
under](http://blog.app.net/2014/05/06/app-net-state-of-the-union/). It
reached number 78 on the Top Paid section of the US App Store a few
months after it was released.
