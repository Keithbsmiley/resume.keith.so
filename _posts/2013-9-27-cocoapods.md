[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a Ruby based tool for managing 3rd
party dependencies in Objective-C projects. I began managing the
repository of library specifications and contributing small amounts to
the tool itself, while submitting my own projects to CocoaPods. I have
since become the primary specs repo maintainer, where I manage 3rd party
submissions to CocoaPods.
